### GDSII (Graphic Design System II)

* Is in Binary Format
* Contains:
		* Layers
		* Geometry shapes
		* Text Labels
* Large files in the order of 100 gigabytes or terabytes
* Compression doesn't help a lot, uncompressing also takes a lot of time
* Loading and processing time is huge.
* Data length is fixed to 32 bits (not adequate for nanoscale structures on 300mm wafers)
* Link <a href ="https://www.artwork.com/gdsii/gdsii/"> GDSII File Descriptions	</a>
* De facto industry standard
* Final file that is sent to the foundry

### OASIS

* Is also in Binary format, But with variable data length
* Thus adequate for even nanoscale structures of 300mm wafers
* Contains similar information to GDSII
* Much smaller file size compared to GDSII due to intelligent compression strategies
* Recognizes complex pattern in data and saves them as individual instances or geometry objects
* Compared to conventional gzip, OASIS CBLOCKS compress the individual cells within the layout
* Files do not need to be temporarily uncompressed and can be unzipped in parallel
* To save loading time, it contains a lookup table containing the location of different cells within the file 
* Also the final file sent to foundry
